# Seeloewen ItemDumper

This simple mod is used to dump a list of all registered items of the current instance to a file. These ids can be used for development purposes or similar. The main reason why this project was created is the use for the [Random Item Giver Datapack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/random-item-giver-datapack-1-0-0-minecraft-1-16-2/). Using this mod, you can generate a list of items to include in the datapack.

The items are currently only written into a new file on every startup of your game. These files are located in the "seeloewen\_itemdumper" folder in your .minecraft directory. The file consists of entries in the format **ModId:ItemId.**

This project is also available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/seeloewen-itemdumper).

## Important Notice

**Please note that this mod is still very experimental and in an early stage of development! It is still very unstable and may not work as expected. Many features are missing. You should also not use this mod permanently when playing, but only for development purposes as it creates a item dump on every startup, which may fill up your disk with useless files. The creator is liable for any damage or other issues caused by the usage of the mod. Use at your own risk.**
